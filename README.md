# Advent of Slop 2025

This repository is 100% vibe coded.  I don't have time for the calendar this
year, but I am still curious how the agent does.  So far this all has been
done exclusively by Claude Code.

This references the web-browser skill [from my skills repo](github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-commands/).

## Note on Inputs

The inputs in this repository are all generated by Claude Code as well
and the generators are included.

The official policies of Advent of Code ask that people do not share their
inputs.  I strongly disagree with this policy.  It does not prevent someone
from replicating anything anyways (as demonstrated by this repository) but it
makes it harder for people to independently run code far in the future when AOC
no longer exists.
